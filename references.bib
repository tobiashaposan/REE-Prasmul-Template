	abstract = {Carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without hole transport materials (HTMs) are regarded as a promising alternative architecture to realize low-cost, stable photovoltaics. However, poor hole transport and severe charge recombination at the interface of perovskite and carbon layers degrade the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of carbon-based PSCs. Here we report on an innovative method to post-treat a carbon electrode with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), for the growth of a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite at the interface between the perovskite and carbon layers. The resulting ultrathin PEA2PbI4 layer formed within the perovskite/carbon interface improved the poor perovskite/carbon contact. The favorable conduction and valence energy levels of the 2D perovskite interlayer greatly suppressed interfacial charge recombination, which stems from the absence of an HTM. Using our fabrication method, the average PCE of devices was boosted from 11.5\% to 14.5\% with minimal hysteresis loss, and a maximum PCE of 15.6\% was achieved. Moreover, the PEAI-treated devices showed excellent ambient stability. The dual protection of the hydrophobic carbon and 2D perovskite layers enabled the device to retain 92\% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of exposure to ambient conditions (relative humidity: 40 ± 5\%). The thermal stability of the devices was also enhanced, showing no efficiency loss after thermal testing at 150 °C, due to suppressed ion migration.},

It is found that the DSSC utilizing Degussa P25 demonstrated higher performance than that of the device with anatase TiO2. The device utilizing Degussa P25 TiO2 performs the highest η of 1.28\% at the optimum concentration of N719 dye that is 0.4 mM. This because this device possesses the highest absorption in the visible region and lowest leak current. The device utilizing anatase TiO2 performs the highest η of 0.447\% at the optimum concentration of N719 dye that is 0.5 mM.

The investment cost of the whole unit with a capacity of 45 kWe was about IDR 220 million in 2008 comprised of 24\% for gasification unit, 54\% for diesel engine and electric generator, 22\% for transportation of the whole unit from Bandung to the site in South Borneo. The gasification unit was made in local workshop in Bandung, while the diesel-generator was purchased also in a local market. To anticipate the development of biomass based electricity in remote areas, an economic analysis has been made for implementations in 2019. A specific investment cost of 600 USD/kW has been estimated taking account to the escalation and capacity factors. Using a discounted factor of 11\% and biomass cost in the range of 0.03-0.07 USD/kg, the production cost of electricity would be in the range of 0.09-0.16 USD/kWh. This production cost was lower than that of diesel engine fueled with full oil commonly implemented in many remote areas in Indonesia at this moment. This production cost was also lower than the Feed in Tariff in some regions established by Indonesian government in 2017.},

However, the poor stability of PSCs has seriously hindered their commercialization. Among various kinds of PSCs, carbon-based PSCs without hole transport materials (C-PSCs) seem to be the most promising for addressing the stability issue because carbon materials are stable, inert to ion migration, and inherently water-resistant. Concurrent with the steady rise in PCE of C-PSCs, great progresses have also been attained on the device stability and scaling-up fabrication of C-PSCs, which have well signified the possible commercialization of PSCs in the near future. In this review, we will summarize these progresses with a view of exposing the promising prospect. We start by collating recent stability testing results of C-PSCs with reference to those of HTM-PSCs. Then, we update the research status on large-scale C-PSCs and their associated scalable fabrication technologies. Finally, we identify main issues to be addressed alongside future research directions.},

Waste profile of each location was determined using population data obtained from National Population Commission (NPC) located in Ibadan and the per capita waste generation gathered from literature. The economic viability of the projects was determined using levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and Net Present Value (NPV) methods. Some of the key results revealed that Port Harcourt (M6), Abuja (M7), Benin (M5) and Ilorin (M8) are potentially feasible and economically viable for waste-to-energy project. However, Abakaliki (M4), Bauchi (M9) and Jalingo (M10) are less viable for such a project. INC and LFGTE technologies provide the best technological option for waste-to-energy project in term of quantity of electricity that can be generated in the cities located in the Northern part of Nigeria based on the kind of wastes that are being generated at the locations while AD present itself as the technology of choice in the cities located in the Southern region. However, from the point view of economic viability, AD is the best option in all the locations followed by LFGTE. INC technology present the highest LCOE and hence less economical for electricity generation in all the locations. This paper is useful to the investors, policy makers, scientist etc. as it could serve as a source of scientific information for decision making which could lead to optimal investment in waste-to-energy project in Nigeria.},

Downdraft gasifiers are typically small-scale units having maximum power production capacity up to 5MW. This feature makes it more suitable for decentralized power generation and distribution to the remote villages/islands deprived of grid electricity. Mathematical models can be helpful for the design of gasifiers, prediction of operational behavior, emissions during normal conditions, startup, shutdown, change of fuel, change of loading, and to alleviate the type of problems mentioned above. It has been observed that although many researchers have developed models of various types and degrees of complexity, reviews of these modeling and simulation studies are scarce. Largely, it is observed that the review articles reported in the literature fail to address the basic understanding of each model types and their applicability to design different gasifiers for a certain feedstock and variation of operating parameters. This review article discusses different models available for downdraft gasifiers such as thermodynamic equilibrium, kinetic, CFD, ANN and ASPEN Plus models. A comparative analysis of each model and its output is carried out. A critical analysis of the effect of different modeling parameters and finally the advantages and disadvantages of each modeling technique is outlined.},

	abstract = {The ability to forecast solar irradiance plays an indispensable role in solar power forecasting, which constitutes an essential step in planning and operating power systems under high penetration of solar power generation. Since solar radiation is an atmospheric process, solar irradiance forecasting, and thus solar power forecasting, can benefit from the participation of atmospheric scientists. In this review, the two fields, namely, atmospheric science and power system engineering are jointly discussed with respect to how solar forecasting plays a part. Firstly, the state of affairs in solar forecasting is elaborated; some common misconceptions are clarified; and salient features of solar irradiance are explained. Next, five technical aspects of solar forecasting: (1) base forecasting methods, (2) post-processing, (3) irradiance-to-power conversion, (4) verification, and (5) grid-side implications, are reviewed. Following that, ten potential research topics for atmospheric scientists are enumerated; they are related to (1) data and tools, (2) numerical weather prediction, (3) forecast downscaling, (4) large eddy simulation, (5) dimming and brightening, (6) aerosols, (7) spatial forecast verification, (8) multivariate probabilistic forecast verification, (9) predictability, and (10) extreme weather events. Last but not least, a pathway towards ultra-high PV penetration is laid out, based on two recently proposed concepts of firm generation and firm forecasting. It is concluded that the collaboration between the atmospheric science community and power engineering community is necessary if we are to further increase the solar penetration while maintaining the stability and reliability of the power grid, and to achieve carbon neutrality in the long run.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rser.2019.109608},
	abstract = {Currently, several kinds of solar cells are developed and among them, organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received substantial interest because they have shown panchromatic light absorption capacities using low amounts of earth abundant materials, low exciton recombination rate, high carrier mobility and high solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) which can exceed 22\%. In most PSCs, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) semiconductor perovskite is sandwiched between an electron transport material (ETM, n-type material) and a hole transport material (HTM, a p-type material). Two kinds of n-i-p and p-i-n configurations are fabricated which depends on the relative positions of the ETM and HTM layers in the device. The ETM in the n-i-p solar cell is usually a planar or mesoporous TiO2 thin film in which the perovskite solution is infiltrated. A disadvantage of the n-i-p cell is using very expensive HTM, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Although numerous HTMs have been introduced, spiro-OMeTAD is the most efficient HTM. Nonetheless, spiro-OMeTAD must be ultra-pure to produce high performance and this increases its price which is not cost-effective from economical viewpoint. Additionally, its pristine form performs badly and doping is necessary to improve its hole-mobility and conductivity. Also, the common dopants including 4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium salts and cobalt complex are corrosive and very hygroscopic which result in the device instability. In the p-i-n cells, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is extensively utilized as the HTM which is UV-unstable and hydrophilic that makes the device unstable. Furthermore, it is only deposited through solution coating process and shows acidic property that reacts with its underlying transparent conductive oxide. Thus, many attempts have been done to substitute the spiro-OMeTAD with other materials to find HTMs suitable for commercialization of PSCs. In this review, recent researches performed to improve the PCEs of PSCs using different classes of HTMs are studied.},

	abstract = {Although the efficiency of small‐size perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached an incredible level of 25.25\%, there is still a substantial loss in performance when switching from small size devices to large‐scale solar modules. The large efficiency deficit is primarily associated with the big challenge of coating homogeneous, large‐area, high‐quality thin films via scalable processes. Here, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, which are the key steps for perovskite film formation. Several thin‐film crystallization techniques, including antisolvent, hot‐casting, vacuum quenching, and gas blowing, are then summarized to distinguish their applications for scalable fabrication of perovskite thin films. In viewing the essential importance of the film morphology on device performance, several strategies including additive engineering, Lewis acid‐based approach, solvent annealing, etc., which are capable of modulating the crystal morphology of perovskite film, are discussed. Finally, we summarize the recent progress in the scalable deposition of large‐scale perovskite thin film for high‐performance devices.},

The enormous potential of PSCs is evident from the fact that the efficiency of these cells has risen from 3.8\% to 25.2\% within a decade, and it is continuously rising to date. We discuss the features making PSCs superior to contemporary PV technologies. The description of the evolution of efficiency and various architectures used to date has been presented. The perovskite film fabrication techniques with some large scale perovskite solar cell manufacturing techniques are discussed. Despite positive traits, the PSCs have faced some issues, such as degradation in the presence of moisture, oxygen, and UV, toxicity, etc. The impact of these factors with various remedies adopted by researchers has been discussed. However, the instability issue raised by toxicity is not of much concern is supported in this paper. These issues creating obstacles in the path of commercialization of PSCs along with the commercialization road map are discussed thoroughly.},

To become economically feasible for commercial production, perovskite solar cells must meet or exceed industry standards for operational lifetime and reliability. In this regard, mixed dimensional 2D-3D perovskite solar cells, incorporating long carbon-chain organic spacer cations, have shown promising results, with enhancement in both device efficiency and stability. Dimensional engineering of perovskite films requires a delicate balance of 2D and 3D perovskite composition to take advantage of the specific properties of each material phase. This review summarizes and assesses the current understanding, and apparent contradictions in the state-of-the-art mixed dimensional perovskite solar cell literature regarding the origin of stability and performance enhancement. By combining and comparing results from experimental and theoretical studies it is focused on how the perovskite composition, film formation methods, additive and solvent engineering influence efficiency and stability, and identify future research directions to further improve both key performance metrics.},

Solar photovoltaics (PV) has been recognized as one of the potential alternatives with environmental and cost-effective aspects. The conventional Silicon solar cells have been champion at both the laboratory and industrial scales and dominated the PV market owing to inexpensive generation of electricity, but its cost is relatively higher vis-à-vis to the second and third generation solar cell technologies. Over the years, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have grabbed incredible attention and attained excellent PV performance owing to their competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) which hiked from 3.1 \% to 25.7 \% and could be a reasonable cost-effective alternative to Si-based technology too. Despite of the plagued performance and desirable properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), still these cells have stability issues and the maximum lifetime that a PSC attained is 1 year while the champion Silicon solar cells have a lifetime of up to 25 years.

	abstract = {Solar forecasters have hitherto been restricting the application of numerical weather prediction (NWP) to day-ahead forecasting scenarios. With the hourly updated NWP models, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Rapid Refresh (RAP) or High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), it is theoretically possible to utilize NWP for hour-ahead solar forecasting. Nonetheless, for NWP-based hourly forecasts to be useful, they ought to be post-processed, because such forecasts are almost always affected by the inherent bias of dynamical weather models. In this regard, Kalman filtering is herein used as a post-processing tool. Using one year of RAP and HRRR forecasts and ground-based observations made at seven geographically diverse locations in the contiguous United States, it is demonstrated that the post-processed versions of hourly updated NWP forecasts are sometimes able to attain a higher accuracy than those from classic time-series families of models, not only at long-range, but also at short-range forecast horizons. Although these improvements are marginal in terms of squared loss (about 1\%–2\%), since NWP models have a very different forecast-generating mechanism (solving the governing equations of motion) from that of time series methods (extrapolating data), NWP-based forecasts can be expected to be less correlated with those forecasts from time series models. Consequently, one should find this diversity profoundly rewarding during forecast combination, for the combined forecasts are able to consistently result in smaller error than the best component forecasts.},

In particular, for each type of SC, a description of the device's architecture, a summary of its performance, and a quantitative assessment of the radiation resistance are presented. Finally, considering the high potential that 2D-materials (such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have in improving both performance and stability of SCs, a brief overview of some important results concerning the influence of radiation on both 2D materials-based devices and monolayer of 2D materials is also included.},

We present here the proof-of-concept for mixed light harvester prepared from CsPbBr3 halide and an inorganic SnS:ZnS photoactive layer (PAL) to broaden the spectral absorption from 550 nm to 700 nm. Owing to the reduced surface defects on the perovskite film, improved charge extraction, and broadened light response, the all-inorganic PSC with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon delivered a short-circuit current density of 8.21 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.57 V, a fill factor of 79.6\%, and a champion PCE as high as 10.26\% under one sun illumination. The preliminary results also suggest that these devices are relatively stable under persistent conditions of 80\% RH or temperature of 80 °C in air. The proof-of-concept for mixed perovskite/PAL absorber provides new opportunities for a wide-spectral response and therefore markedly increased the PCE outputs.},

	abstract = {A new biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC), which featured an innovative two-stage enriched air gasification system coupling a fluidized bed with a swirl-melting furnace, was proposed and built for clean and efficient biomass utilization. The performance of biomass gasification and power generation under various operating conditions was assessed using a comprehensive Aspen Plus model for system optimization. The model was validated by pilot-scale experimental data and gas turbine regulations, showing good agreement. Parameters including oxygen percentage of enriched air (OP), gasification temperature, excess air ratio and compressor pressure ratio were studied for BIGCC optimization. Results showed that increase OP could effectively improve syngas quality and two-stage gasification efficiency, enhancing the gas turbine inlet and outlet temperature. The maximum BIGCC fuel utilization efficiency could be obtained at OP of 40\%. Increasing gasification temperature showed a negative effect on the two-stage gasification performance. For efficient BIGCC operation, the excess air ratio should be below 3.5 to maintain a designed gas turbine inlet temperature. Modest increase of compressor pressure ratio favored the power generation. Finally, the BIGCC energy analysis further proved the rationality of system design and sufficient utilization of biomass energy.},

The reduced degradation under air exposure is attributed to the improved thermodynamic stability after dimensional reduction, the encapsulating organic ligands, and the compact perovskite film preventing oxygen ingress. We then explore these highly oriented low-dimensional Sn perovskite films in solar cells. The perpendicular growth of the perovskite domains between electrodes allows efficient charge carrier transport, leading to power conversion efficiencies of 5.94\% without the requirement of further device structure engineering.

The long-term durability of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells necessitates the protection of perovskite thin films from moisture to prevent material decomposition. Herein, we report that the electrical resistivity and the moisture stability of two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n-1SnnI3n+1 perovskites are considerably improved compared to those of the three-dimensional (3D) CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite and subsequently show the solar cell fabrication using a simple one-step spin-coating method. These 2D perovskites are semiconductors with optical band gaps progressively decreasing from 1.83 eV (n = 1) to 1.20 eV (n = ). The n = 3 and n = 4 members with optimal band gaps of 1.50 and 1.42 eV for solar cells, respectively, were thus chosen for in-depth studies. We demonstrate that thin films of 2D perovskites orient the \{(CH3NH3)n-1SnnI3n+1\}2- slabs parallel to the substrate when dimethyl sulfoxide solvent is used for deposition, and this orientation can be flipped to perpendicular when N,N-dimethylformamide solvent is used. We find that high-purity, single-phase films can be grown only by using precursor solutions of "pre-synthesized" single-phase bulk perovskite materials. We introduce for the first time the use of triethylphosphine as an effective antioxidant, which suppresses the doping level of the 2D films and improves film morphology. The resulting semiconducting 2D Sn-based iodide perovskite films were incorporated in solar cells yielding a power conversion efficiency of 2.5\% from the Sn4I13 member. From the temporal stability standpoint, the 2D Sn perovskite solar cells outperform their 3D analogs.},

DPW could be a useful source of feedstock to generate sustainable and renewable energy via various thermochemical processes. The core objective of current investigation is to convert the DPW into syngas and the electricity generation from the produced syngas. Furthermore, to configure an integrated system to predict the gas composition and power generation under operating variables of temperature, steam/biomass ratio, compression ratio, and air flowrate. The integrated process simulation model of gasification and power generation model was developed using Aspen Plus V10®. The model consisted of two parts; the production of syngas from steam gasification and the second was the combustion-integrated power turbine system for power generation. The syngas composition at a temperature of 850 °C and steam/biomass of 1.0 was obtained as; H2 37.88 vol\%, CO 14.24 vol\%, CO2 11.29 vol\%, CH4 0.001 vol\%. The power generation from the gas turbine increased from 3.2 to 3.6 MW with the increase in temperature. Whereas the total power generation was in the range of 3.2 to 5 MW with an increased steam flowrate of 500–2500 kg/h. Energy analysis shows that the process heat integration of the system is able to fulfill the 78 \% utilities requirement within the system. This study provides the potential utilization of DPW for renewable fuel gas and electricity generation through a sustainable route and also provides environmentally friendly disposal of DPW in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world.},

	abstract = {Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged as very promising semiconductors with efficiencies exceeding 22\% making them a serious candidate for next generation solar cells. All current high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including the most recent world records, were achieved using the so-called anti-solvent method. Here, an anti-solvent, typically chlorobenzene (CB), is used to induce rapid crystallisation of a liquid perovskite precursor resulting in highly homogenous, pinhole-free planar perovskite films. While this has yielded very impressive high-performance results, few efforts have been dedicated to the fundamental understanding of the anti-solvent method. In this work, a systematic study is employed to understand the influence of anti-solvent treatment on both morphological and optoelectronic characteristics of PSCs. Perovskite absorber films were treated using CB and isopropanol (IPA) for comparing anti-solvents with different polarities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that IPA treated perovskite films have a more uniform morphology with larger grains in comparison to CB processed perovskite films. Despite the improved morphology and solar cell performance the devices with IPA treated perovskites suffer from higher hysteresis during current density-voltage (J-V) scans. We found that this enhanced hysteresis stems mainly from higher charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface under illumination that could also lead to formation of excess electrostatic potential contributing to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc). Our study provides a way for in-depth spectroscopic analysis methods aiding a deeper understanding of the interfacial charge characteristics and the fundamental mechanisms of PSCs.},

Using these highly crystalline films, obtained by mixing a very small amount (0.08 m) of layered (2D) Sn perovskite with 0.92 m (3D) FASnI3, for the first time a PCE as high as 9.0\% in a planar p–i–n device structure is achieved. These devices display negligible hysteresis and light soaking, as they benefit from very low trap-assisted recombination, low shunt losses, and more efficient charge collection. This represents a 50\% improvement in PCE compared to the best reference cell based on a pure FASnI3 film using SnF2 as a reducing agent. Moreover, the 2D/3D-based HPSCs show considerable improved stability due to the enhanced robustness of the perovskite film compared to the reference cell.},

Derived from their 3D analogues, 2D perovskites are formed by inserting bulky alkylammonium cations in-between the anionic layers. However, these insulating organic spacer cations also hinder charge transport. Herein, such a 2D perovskite, (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13, that contains short branched-chain spacer cations (iso-BA+) and shows a remarkable increase of optical absorption and crystallinity in comparison to the conventional linear one, n-BA+, is designed. After applying the hot-casting (HC) technique, all these properties are further improved. The HC (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 sample exhibits the best ambient stability by maintaining its initial optical absorption after storage of 840 h in an environmental chamber at 20 °C with a relative humidity of 60\% without encapsulation. More importantly, the out-of-plane crystal orientation of (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film is notably enhanced, which increases cross-plane charge mobility. As a result, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) measured from for current density versus voltage curves afford 8.82\% and 10.63\% for room-temperature and HC-processed 2D perovskites based planar solar cells, respectively. However, the corresponding steady-state PCEs are remarkably lower, which is presumably due to the significant hysteresis phenomena caused by low charge extraction efficiency at interfaces of C60/2D perovskites.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising thin-film solar cell materials owing to their remarkable photophysical properties1-5, which have led to power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent6,7, with the prospect of further improvements towards the Shockley- Queisser limit for a single-junction solar cell (33.5 per cent)8. Besides efficiency, another critical factor for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications is environmental stability and photostability under operating conditions9-15. In contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts, Ruddlesden-Popper phases-layered two-dimensional perovskite films-have shown promising stability, but poor efficiency at only 4.73 per cent13,16,17. This relatively poor efficiency is attributed to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic cations, which act like insulating spacing layers between the conducting inorganic slabs. Here we overcome this issue in layered perovskites by producing thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to facilitate efficient charge transport. We report a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52 per cent with no hysteresis, and the devices exhibit greatly improved stability in comparison to their three-dimensional counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress tests. Unencapsulated two-dimensional perovskite devices retain over 60 per cent of their efficiency for over 2,250 hours under constant, standard (AM1.5G) illumination, and exhibit greater tolerance to 65 per cent relative humidity than do three-dimensional equivalents. When the devices are encapsulated, the layered devices do not show any degradation under constant AM1.5G illumination or humidity. We anticipate that these results will lead to the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered, hybrid, perovskite thin films, which are essential for high-performance opto-electronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability.},

We have reported the fabrication and properties of a series of 2D perovskite compounds (PEI)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 5, 7) by incorporating polyethylenimine (PEI) cations within the layered structure. The benefits of using intercalated polymer cations in the multilayered films are multiple: moisture resistance and film quality are greatly enhanced compared to that of their 3D MAPbI3 analogue; charge transport within solar cells can also be improved compared to that of 2D materials using small-molecule bulky ammonium. The moisture-stable nature of the multilayered perovskite materials allow for the simple one-step fabrication of cells with an aperture area of 2.32 cm2 under ambient humidity that have a PCE up to 8.77\%. Overall, the 2D perovskite family offers rich multitudes of substituent and crystal structures, defining a promising class of stable and efficient light-absorbing materials.},

	abstract = {We present the new homologous series (C(NH2)3)(CH3NH3)nPbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3) of layered 2D perovskites. Structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that these compounds adopt an unprecedented structure type, which is stabilized by the alternating ordering of the guanidinium and methylammonium cations in the interlayer space (ACI). Compared to the more common Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) 2D perovskites, the ACI perovskites have a different stacking motif and adopt a higher crystal symmetry. The higher symmetry of the ACI perovskites is expressed in their physical properties, which show a characteristic decrease of the bandgap with respect to their RP perovskite counterparts with the same perovskite layer thickness (n). The compounds show a monotonic decrease in the optical gap as n increases: Eg = 2.27 eV for n = 1 to Eg = 1.99 eV for n = 2 and Eg = 1.73 eV for n = 3, which show slightly narrower gaps compared to the corresponding RP perovskites. First-principles theoretical electronic structure calculations confirm the experimental optical gap trends suggesting that the ACI perovskites are direct bandgap semiconductors with wide valence and conduction bandwidths. To assess the potential of the ACI perovskites toward solar cell applications, we studied the (C(NH2)3)(CH3NH3)3Pb3I10 (n = 3) compound. Compact thin films from the (C(NH2)3)(CH3NH3)3Pb3I10 compound with excellent surface coverage can be obtained from the antisolvent dripping method. Planar photovoltaic devices from optimized ACI perovskite films yield a power-conversion-efficiency of 7.26\% with a high open-circuit voltage of ∼1 V and a striking fill factor of ∼80\%.},

A Voc of more than 1.4 V and, at the same time, a PCE of 9.5\% for cells with hole transport material (HTM) were displayed, whereas a Voc value of 1.37 V and a PCE of 7.9\% were achieved for HTM-free cells. Bromide quasi 2D perovskites were synthesized using various long organic barriers (e.g., benzyl ammonium, BA; phenylethyl ammonium, PEA; and propyl phenyl ammonium, PPA). The influence of different barrier molecules on the quasi 2D perovskite's properties was studied using absorbance, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. No change was observed in the exciton binding energy as a result of changing the barrier molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) with spin-orbit coupling calculations showed that in the case of BA, holes are delocalized over the whole molecule, whereas for PEA and PPA, they are delocalized more at the phenyl ring. This factor influences the electrical conductivity of holes, which is highest for BA in comparison with the other barriers. In the case of electrons, the energy onset for the nonzero conductivity is lowest for BA. Both calculations support the better PV performance observed for the quasi 2D perovskite based on BA as the barrier. Finally, using contact angle measurements, it was shown that the quasi 2D perovskite is more hydrophobic than the 3D perovskite. Stability measurements showed that cells based on the quasi 2D perovskite are more stable than cells based on the 3D perovskite.},

In this work, 2D perovskite of the structure (PEA)2(MA)n–1PbnBr3n+1 has been sensitized, where PEA is phenyl ethyl-ammonium, MA is methyl-ammonium, and using only bromide as the halide. The number of the perovskite layers has been varied (n) from n = 1 through n = ∞. Optical and physical characterization verify the layered structure and the increase in the band gap. The photovoltaic performance shows higher open circuit voltage (Voc) for the quasi 2D perovskite (i.e., n = 40, 50, 60) compared to the 3D perovskite. Voc of 1.3 V without hole transport material (HTM) and Voc of 1.46 V using HTM have been demonstrated, with corresponding efficiency of 6.3\% and 8.5\%, among the highest reported. The lower mobility and transport in the quasi 2D perovskites have been proved effective to gain high Voc with high efficiency, further supported by ab initio calculations and charge extraction measurements. Bromide is the only halide used in these quasi 2D perovskites, as mixing halides have recently revealed instability of the perovskite structure. These quasi 2D materials are promising candidates for use in optoelectronic applications that simultaneously require high voltage and high efficiency.},

In this study, to provide guidelines for developing a suitable waste management strategy for Depok, Indonesia, emissions from four waste management scenarios for the city are calculated. These scenarios involve treatments such as the application of Waste Treatment Unit (WTU), incinerator, anaerobic digester, composting, and landfill. The best scenario affords the treatment of 150 tons/day of municipal solid waste (MSW) via composting, 80 tons via WTU, and 500 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 390 tons/day, which are sent to a controlled landfill in Depok. This best scenario generates net GHG emissions of 202,800 kg CO2-eq/day, accounting for 1900 kg CO2-eq/day from transportation; 4 kg CO2-eq/day from WTU; 25,700 kg CO2-eq/day from composting; 46,200 kg CO2-eq/day from anaerobic digestion; and 129,000 kg CO2-eq/day from a controlled landfill. By contrast, the worst scenario corresponds to the city's current waste management approach, producing net GHG emissions of 299,602.6 kg CO2-eq/day from the treatment of 600 tons/day of MSW via landfill, 70 tons/day via open burning, 60 tons/day via MRF, 340 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 40 tons/day via composting.},

In this work, it is investigated the effect of the relative humidity (RH) and type of atmosphere (nitrogen vs air) used during the deposition of both perovskite layer and hole extraction layer (HEL). While humidity and oxygen seem not to affect the HEL deposition step, the perovskite layer is notoriously influenced by the RH and by the presence of oxygen during its deposition. Until 10\% of RH, the performance of devices prepared with a triple-cation perovskite layer deposited under a nitrogen environment was mostly unaffected, whilst for devices deposited in air that limit is lower. On the other hand, for high RH values (above 30\%), devices prepared with a triple-cation perovskite layer deposited under N2 presented slightly better stability over time than the ones prepared under air. The best-performing device was prepared with a triple-cation perovskite layer deposited under dry air, presenting a power conversion efficiency of 16.7\%. These results are of critical value when designing a plant for fabricating PSC showing that the perovskite layer may be deposited under a simple dry air atmosphere (RH {\textless} 1\%).},

The relativistic GW approximation has been demonstrated to be able to capture electronic structure accurately, but at an extremely high computational cost. Here we report efficient and accurate band gap calculations of halide metal perovskites by using the approximate quasiparticle DFT-1/2 method. Using AMX3 (A = CH3NH3, CH2NHCH2, Cs; M = Pb, Sn, X = I, Br, Cl) as demonstration, the influence of the crystal structure (cubic, tetragonal or orthorhombic), variation of ions (different A, M and X) and relativistic effects on the electronic structure are systematically studied and compared with experimental results. Our results show that the DFT-1/2 method yields accurate band gaps with the precision of the GW method with no more computational cost than standard DFT. This opens the possibility of accurate electronic structure prediction of sophisticated halide perovskite structures and new materials design for lead-free materials.},

Some researchers have suggested anomalous behavior of PSCs to the polarizations due to the ion migration or ferroelectric behavior. Experimental results and theoretical calculations have suggested the possibility of ferroelectricity in organic-inorganic perovskite. However, still no studies have been concretely discarded the ferroelectric nature of perovskite absorbers in PSCs. Hysteresis of P-E (polarization-electric field) loops is an important evidence to confirm the ferroelectricity. In this study, P-E loop measurements, in-depth structural study, analyses of dielectric behavior and the phase transitions of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite were carried out and investigated. The results suggest that CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite is in an antiferroelectric phase at room temperature. The antiferroelectric phase can be switched to ferroelectric phase by the poling treatment and exhibits ferroelectric-like hysteresis P-E loops and dielectric behavior around room temperature; namely, the perovskite can generate a ferroelectric polarization under PSCs operating conditions.

	abstract = {Annealing is one of the processing methods that are used for the fabrication of defect-free, photoactive perovskite films with compact grains in highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Thus, the annealing temperature is a key parameter for the control of the interdiffusion (of constituent elements) in photoactive films. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic study of the effects of annealing on the interdiffusion of constituent elements in efficient formamidinium-based PSCs. We also explore the effects of annealing-induced interdiffusion on layer microstructures, local strains, and the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films. We observe a dramatic upward diffusion of tin (Sn) and titanium (Ti) from fluorine-doped tin oxide and titanium dioxide (TiO2) to the perovskite films. We also observe a downward diffusion of lead (Pb) and iodine (I) from the perovskite films to the mesoporous layer of the electron transporting layer (ETL), after annealing at temperatures between 100 and 150 °C. The diffused I substitutes for Ti in the ETL, which improves the optoelectronic properties of the films, for annealing temperatures between 100 and 130 °C. The annealing-induced interdiffusion that occurs at higher temperatures (between 140 and 150 °C) results in higher levels of interdiffusion, along with increased local strains that lead to the nucleation of pores and cracks. Finally, the implications of the results are discussed for the design of PSCs with improved photoconversion efficiencies and stability.},

	abstract = {Controlling the crystallization and morphology of perovskite films is crucial for the fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. For the first time, we investigate the formation mechanism of the drop-cast perovskite film from its precursor solution, PbCl2 and CH3NH3I in N,N-dimethylformamide, to a crystalline CH3NH3PbI3-xClx film at different substrate temperatures from 70 to 180 °C in ambient air and humidity. We employed an in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique for this study. When the substrate temperature is at or below 100 °C, the perovskite film is formed in three stages: the initial solution stage, transition-to-solid film stage, and transformation stage from intermediates into a crystalline perovskite film. In each stage, the multiple routes for phase transformations are preceded concurrently. However, when the substrate temperature is increased from 100 to 180 °C, the formation mechanism of the perovskite film is changed from the "multistage formation mechanism" to the "direct formation mechanism". The proposed mechanism has been applied to understand the formation of a perovskite film containing an additive. The result of this study provides a fundamental understanding of the functions of the solvent and additive in the solution and transition states to the crystalline film. It provides useful knowledge to design and fabricate crystalline perovskite films for high-efficiency solar cells.},

Surface texture remains important for lowering the contact angle hysteresis. In this chapter, the importance of mimicking nature for self-cleaning applications is introduced. Surface treatment methods including various techniques for changing the surface wetting state from hydrophilic to hydrophobic are presented. Requirements for the optical transmittance of hydrophobic surfaces prepared for self-cleaning applications are discussed in detail.

The in situ grown DJ 2D perovskite layer on the 3D one plays crucial roles in improving not only the PSC stability contributed by its intrinsically stable structure without the weak van der Waals interactions but also the device efficiency because of the formation of cascade HOMO levels favorable for hole transfer and extraction. Consequently, unencapsulated DJ 2D-3D PSCs afford a best efficiency of 21.6\% with high stability under a constant relative humidity of 85\%, much better than RP 2D-3D and 3D counterparts.

Here, we demonstrate a perovskite/perovskite heterojunction solar cell. We developed a facile solution-based cation infiltration process to deposit layered perovskite (LPK) structures onto methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) films. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments were performed to gain insights into the crystallite orientation and the formation process of the perovskite bilayer. Our results show that the self-assembly of the LPK layer on top of an intact MAPI layer is accompanied by a reorganization of the perovskite interface. This leads to an enhancement of the open-circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency due to reduced recombination losses, as well as improved moisture stability in the resulting photovoltaic devices.},

The power-conversion efficiency of these perovskite photovoltaics depends on the base materials used in their development, and methylammonium lead iodide is generally used as the main component. Perovskite materials have been further explored to increase their efficiency, as they are cheaper and easier to fabricate than silicon photovoltaics, which will lead to better commercialization. Even with these advantages, perovskite photovoltaics have a few drawbacks, such as their stability when in contact with heat and humidity, which pales in comparison to the 25-year stability of silicon, even with improvements are made when exploring new materials. To expand the benefits and address the drawbacks of perovskite photovoltaics, perovskite–silicon tandem photovoltaics have been suggested as a solution in the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. This tandem photovoltaic results in an increased PCE value by presenting a better total absorption wavelength for both perovskite and silicon photovoltaics.

The 2D layer defines the interfacial chemistry and physics at the 2D/3D bilayer and endows the 2D/3D structure with better chemical and thermal stability. Herein, 2D/3D (CF3-PEA)2FA0.85MA0.15Pb2I7/FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 planar heterojunction perovskite was produced using a facile interfacial ion exchange process. The 2D (CF3-PEA)2FA0.85MA0.15Pb2I7 capping layer can not only passivate the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 film but also act as super-hydrophobic layer to inhibit water diffusion and significantly enhance the stability. The 2D capping layer can also establish a unique graded band structure at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface and lead to p-type doping for Spiro-OMeTAD layer which is beneficial for efficient charge transport. Optimized PSCs based on this 2D/3D heterojunction yield a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1\% and improved stability.

However, poor hole transport and severe charge recombination at the interface of perovskite and carbon layers degrade the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of carbon-based PSCs. Here we report on an innovative method to post-treat a carbon electrode with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), for the growth of a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite at the interface between the perovskite and carbon layers. The resulting ultrathin PEA2PbI4 layer formed within the perovskite/carbon interface improved the poor perovskite/carbon contact. The favorable conduction and valence energy levels of the 2D perovskite interlayer greatly suppressed interfacial charge recombination, which stems from the absence of an HTM. Using our fabrication method, the average PCE of devices was boosted from 11.5\% to 14.5\% with minimal hysteresis loss, and a maximum PCE of 15.6\% was achieved. Moreover, the PEAI-treated devices showed excellent ambient stability. The dual protection of the hydrophobic carbon and 2D perovskite layers enabled the device to retain 92\% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of exposure to ambient conditions (relative humidity: 40 ± 5\%). The thermal stability of the devices was also enhanced, showing no efficiency loss after thermal testing at 150 °C, due to suppressed ion migration.},

Cooling the device to 20 °C and operating at the maximum power point improves the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells over 100× compared to operation under open circuit conditions at 60 °C.

Yet, the role of 5-AVAI in enhancing the stability has yet to be determined. Here, superoxide-mediated degradation of MAPI m-CPSC with and without the 5-AVAI additive is studied using the fluorescence probe dihydroethidium for superoxide detection. In situ X-ray diffractometry shows that aminovaleric acid methylammonium lead iodide (AVA-MAPI) perovskite infiltrated in mesoporous layers presents higher stability in an ambient environment under illumination, evidenced by a slower decrease of the MAPI/PbI2 peak ratio. Superoxide yield measurements demonstrate that AVA-MAPI generates more superoxide than regular MAPI when deposited on glass but generates significantly less when infiltrated in mesoporous layers. It is believed that superoxide formation in m-CPSC is dependent on a combination of competitive factors including oxygen diffusion, sample morphology, grain size, and defect concentration.},

	abstract = {Recently, metal halide perovskite photovoltaics (PV) are marching toward commercialization. The possibility for perovskite absorbers to be incorporated into multi-junction solar cells is also being discussed, which suggests alternative market entry. Although intensive investigations are being made on their technical feasibility, serious analysis on the cost of perovskite-based tandem modules is lacking. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of solar modules is often used to evaluate technoeconomic competitiveness. Here, we performed a detailed cost analysis on two perovskite-based tandem modules (the perovskite/c-silicon and the perovskite/perovskite tandem module) compared with standard multi-crystalline silicon and single-junction perovskite solar cells. We found that perovskite PVs (both single junction and multi-junction) are competitive in the context of LCOE if the module lifetime is comparable with that of c-silicon solar cells. This encourages further efforts to push perovskite tandem modules onto the market in the future. Solar energy is the most abundant resource to power this planet. Photovoltaics (PV) harvest solar energy in a clean manner, wherein the relevant technologies are mostly based on crystalline silicon. Featuring skyrocketing efficiency and extreme low cost, hybrid halide perovskite solar cells have emerged as the most promising next-generation PV technology. Moreover, they can be coupled with a complimentary absorber to form tandem solar cells, which may face fewer obstacles for market penetration by capitalizing on the established PV industry. It is thus important to establish the technoeconomic competitiveness of final electricity production. We estimated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) using a sensitivity analysis by varying the materials, module efficiency, and lifetime. We found that perovskite tandem PVs are potentially competitive, and further efforts are required to simultaneously improve the efficiency and lifetime of perovskite PVs to stand over the entire energy sector. Perovskite tandem solar cells show technoeconomic competitiveness over the PV market.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.1039/d2se00029f},
	abstract = {With high efficiency and fast processing, metal halide perovskite (PK) solar cells promise a new paradigm for low-cost solar power. In addition to single junction device performance that is near the internal Shockley-Queisser limit, new tandem configurations promise even higher efficiencies. Efforts to commercialize PK-based modules are hindered by several factors including questions of cost and performance in the field. Long lifetimes are needed to achieve a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and establish bankability. To understand the impact of device lifetime on LCOE we compared bottom-up cost and energy yield analyses for single-junction and tandem solar modules based on optical modeling of the device stacks, the device physics, and real-world advanced irradiance and temperature variation data. The degradation rate was taken to be a variable to examine the impact of stability on the LCOE. We show that both device and field lifetimes are critical to achieve a low LCOE for a solar power station. Additionally, for all PK device lifetimes, tandems constructed with higher-cost tandem partners will be economically disadvantaged in the market place.},

	title = {Sequential vacuum-evaporated perovskite solar cells with more than 24\% efficiency},
	url = {https://www.science.org},
	abstract = {Vacuum evaporation is promising for the high-throughput fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of its solvent-free characteristic, precise control of film thickness, and compatibility with large-scale production. Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs fabricated by vacuum evaporation lags behind that of solution-processed PSCs. Here, we report a Cl-containing alloy-mediated sequential vacuum evaporation approach to fabricate perovskite films. The presence of Cl in the alloy facilitates organic ammonium halide diffusion and the subsequent perovskite conversion reaction, leading to homogeneous pinhole-free perovskite films with few defects. The resulting PSCs yield a PCE of 24.42\%, 23.44\% (certified 22.6\%), and 19.87\% for 0.1, 1.0, and 14.4 square centimeters (mini-module, aperture area), respectively. The unencapsulated PSCs show good stability with negligible decline in performance after storage in dry air for more than 4000 hours. Our method provides a reproducible approach for scalable fabrication of large-area, high-efficiency PSCs and other perovskite-based optoelectronics.},
